  <h1>Husky Shield</h1>
  <p>
    Husky Shield was a project that I worked on during my Freshman Year at UW,
    as a part of my Design Methods class (INFO 360) taught by Professor Jeremy
    Zaretzky. For this project, I worked with a team of 4 other students to
    create a solution to one of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals
    (SDG). We decided to focus on the Gender Equality SDG, with an emphisis on
    Sexual Assault and Harassment.

    Thinking about our own experiences at UW, we wanted to create a solution to
    help women and non-binary students feel safe while on campus. Currently, we
    found that a lot of students use a combination of location sharing and text
    messaging to communicate in potentially dangerous situations (first dates,
    late night walking home from the library, etc). These current solutions are
    not comprehensive enough to be truly effective in dangerous situations, so
    we wanted to address these very valid concerns within a single platform.
    Thus, Husky Shield was born.

    Husky Shield is an app meant specifically for women and non-binary students
    at the University of Washington. The app aims to to help these students feel
    safe by enabling:
    <ul>
      <li>Quick & discrete access to 911, UWPD, and emergency contacts</li>
      <li>Instant Messaging to 911, UWPD, and emergency contacts</li>
      <li>Location sharing with emergency contacts</li>
      <li>A personal profile with contact and health information</li>
    </ul>
