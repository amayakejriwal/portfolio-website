  <h1>A New MangoApps Customer Resources Page</h1>
  <p>
    For my final project of Summer 2021, I was given the opportunity to
    re-design and implement a customer resources page for the MangoApps website.
    The new resources page would be available for customers to search through
    marketing content such as case studies, whitepapers, and blog posts.
  </p>
  <p>
    Before I started the project, all of the resources were scattered around the
    site with no easy way for customers to find a resource that applied to their
    company and needs. My goal was to combine all of the resources into a single
    page, where customers could use filters to find specific resources.
  </p>
  <p>
    My first step was to fully understand what type of resources MangoApps
    currently had. I created a spreadsheet of every resource and found that
    there were three main types: case studies, whitepapers, and blog posts. I
    then went in and added some more information about each resource, such as
    the MangoApps product it was about and customer use cases that it discussed,
    to have a better understanding of what each resource was about and why
    customers may want to read it. This holistic approach allowed me to have a
    better understanding of the problem, and ultimately create a better solution.
  </p>
  <p>
    Next, I started to make wireframes for the website design and functionality.
    Specifically, I needed to decide how customers were going to find the
    resources that applied to them. After extensive research I decided to
    implement filters -- it allowed customers to choose exactly what resources
    they saw while still being fairly easy to implement and maintain.
  </p>
  <p>My final step in the design process was to make full mockups for the
    resources page. You can see one of my final mockups below:

  <p>
    After the mockups were finalized, I started to create a prototype for the
    website. I used HTML, CSS, and JS for the basic page functionality. I used
    SQLite to create a database of MangoApps resources and Node.js to connect
    the database to the page.
  </p>
  <p>
    Overall, I really enjoyed this project. It was very cool to be able to apply
    the design and programming skills that I learned in class on a real project.
