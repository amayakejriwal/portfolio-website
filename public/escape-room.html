  <h1>Misinformation Escape Room</h1>
  <p>
    I am currently a Student Assistant for the Center for an Informed Public,
    collaborating with Professor Chris Coward and Professor Jin Ha Lee to create
    a virtual escape room that teaches people about misinformation. You can find
    a link to the virtual escape room <a href="https://www.lokisloop.org/">here</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    My current focus is creating a comprehensive Resource Kit that participants
    would engage with after they complete the escape room. The goal of the
    Resource Kit is to encourage discussion about the escape room and reinforce
    important learnings about misinformation. This includes giving participants
    resources to learn more about the topic and recommendations about how to
    combat misinformation in their everyday lives.
  </p>
  <p>
    Previously, I worked with a group of students to enhance the player
    experience for the virtual escape room. I conducted A/B testing for new game
    designs, which ensured that the team was creating puzzles that were
    challenging, memorable, and easy-to-understand.
