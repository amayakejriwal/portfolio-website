  <h1>Making Workplace Diversity Actionable</h1>
  <p>
    In Spring 2021, I attended a product management summit hosted by the
    University of Washington’s Foster School of Business. At the summit, I had
    the opportunity to collaborate with and learn from product managers and leaders
    from many different backgrounds. I learned a ton about what it means to be a
    product manager, and am very excited to apply my new knowledge in upcoming projects.
  </p>
  <p>
    One conversation, in particular, sparked my interest. My group was discussing
    challenges that we face working remotely, and how many people we collaborate
    with every day we have never met in person. As a result, there are many small
    but important things that we don’t know about our colleagues that can make a
    huge difference for individuals. Diversity initiatives within companies can
    only go so far without the necessary tools. Name pronunciation and personal
    pronouns were two specific areas that I was able to identify after further
    thought and research about the topic.
  </p>
  <p>
    Thinking back to my own personal experiences at MangoApps, a digital
    workplace platform that has offices in both Pune, India and Issaquah, Wa,
    this was the perfect example and opportunity for improvement. As a part of
    my internships, I have worked extensively with the development teams in India
    but have never spoken to many of them. All of our communication was through
    online workspaces at chat, and the time difference makes it hard to hop on a
    call or talk face-to-face. As a result of this, as well as a language and
    culture barrier, I still don’t know how to pronounce many of their names or
    what pronouns they use.
  </p>
  <p>
    The MangoApps platform was the perfect place to help solve these problems.
    I pitched my idea for two new features to be added to each employee profile
    and business card within the MangoApps platform:
    <ul>
      <li>Name pronunciation audio recording</li>
      <li>Personal pronouns</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    The MangoApps team loved these ideas, and I began to create mockups for each
    of the new features. After some discussions about the implementation of each
    feature, we finalized the design which is currently being developed by the
    MangoApps development team.
  </p>
  <p>
    Both of these initiatives, although seemingly small, go a very long way to
    help promote inclusivity and diversity within the workplace. Individual
    employees feel respected and connected to their colleagues, creating a
    richer environment for everyone.
